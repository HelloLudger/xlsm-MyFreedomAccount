# xlsm-MyFreedomAccount
_Excel spreasheet to manage your Freedom Account._

## What’s new?
Just released the 2016 edition with improved design, better VBA scripts and a new version completely without any VBA, for mobile and web Excel.
Removed the version of 2015. But you can still find it under the tag "2015-final"

##Compatibility?
Tested with Microsoft Excel 2010. Should be working with all newer versions and probably also with most older versions, since it doesn’t use many fancy things.
The `no-VBA` version should work in the Excel web and mobile app, but has some limitations. Check the Medium post in the "More Information?" segment for... more information.

##Feedback?
Yes, PLEASE! I would love to get some feedback! 
Feel free to leave me a comment via Twitter, Medium or here on GitHub.
