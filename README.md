# xlsm-MyFreedomAccount
_Excel spreasheet to manage your Freedom Account._

##Compatibility?
Tested with Microsoft Excel 2010. Should be working with all newer versions and probably also with most older versions, since it doesn’t use many fancy things.

##What’s Next?
The design and the naming of some things is far away from perfect. I plan to update the file at least once per year.
I’m also thinking about a VBA-free version. Of course, I would loose a lot of functionality, but it could run in Excel Online and those Excel mobile app.

##Feedback?
Yes, PLEASE! I would love to get some feedback! 
Feel free to leave me a comment via Twitter, Medium or here on GitHub.

##More Information?
I wrote a Medium post about this project.
I'll add a link as soon as I have one.
